  body: Maybe im being paranoid, but I've been waking up at the same time in the
    middle of the night to observe if the officers I saw that were going to be there
    again, and they were. Not only that, but I've seen them carry a body out of the
    church too. There is definitely something going on. Today is Sunday.
